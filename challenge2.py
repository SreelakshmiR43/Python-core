# coding challenge 2

# Using a for-loop,a)calculates the addition of each number.
x = [10,20,30,40]
for x in range(20,100,20):
    print(x)



# b)Print â€œI Love My India" 7 times.
for i in range(7):
    print("I Love My India")


# 2nd method
x = [10,20,30,40]

for i in x:#x=10,20,30....
    sum = i + i #sum=20,40,60...
    print(sum)
